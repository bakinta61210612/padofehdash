She had guest appearances on the show One Tree Hill, starring <a href=#>Sophia Bush</a>.</p><p>She made her Broadway debut in 1996 as Young Cosette/Young Eponine in Les Misérables. At six, she was the youngest actress ever to play the role. From 1996 to 2001 Bowen was a consistent presence on Broadway. She appeared in the original company of the 1998 revival of The Sound of Music as Marta, and created the role of Adele in the musical version of Jane Eyre in 2000. Bowen was also a member of The Broadway Kids concert group. Several of Bowen’s siblings have also been heavily involved in musical theatre, performing roles in various other Broadway shows.</p><p>From 2004 to 2012, Bowen portrayed Julie Mayer on Desperate Housewives. Prior to being cast in the role, Bowen did not think she would get it, explaining “they were looking for a 12-year-old brunette&nbsp;… and I was a 13-year-old blonde.” As a result, Bowen was asked to dye her hair for the role. Bowen was initially attracted to the series because of the amount of attention paid to the younger characters. She stated, “If you watch a lot of other television shows, the kids don’t have that much [of a] part in it. On this show, the writers give us each our own individual storylines that have a lot of layers to them.” For season three, the character’s storylines began revolving around themes of teenage rebellion and angst. Bowen commented: “She’s going to have, you know, primarily one love interest, and he’s a bit of a bad boy. We’re going to see if she has a positive effect on him, or if he has a negative effect on her. I’m definitely very excited about it&nbsp;… because you kind of get to see a different side to her.” Her character was written off the series after season four. Teri Hatcher expressed disappointment in the decision, but series creator Marc Cherry promised that Bowen would return to the series. Bowen returned to the series for one episode during season five and rejoined the main cast as a series regular for season six. She appeared once in season seven and returned for a string of episodes in the final season.</p><p align=justify>She has five older siblings named Jessica, Jillian, Alex, Graham and Cameron.</p><p align=justify>She has been the youngest actress ever to be cast for the Les Miserables character named Young Cosette.</p><p align=justify>Andrea Lauren Bowen (born March 4, 1990) is an American actress and singer.
