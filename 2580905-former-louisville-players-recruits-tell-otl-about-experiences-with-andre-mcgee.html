In the book, Powell estimated she was paid $10,000 by McGee for supplying dancers to parties.</p><p>The former players and recruits, who spoke to OTL on the condition of anonymity, provided details of the alleged parties.</p><p>One former recruit, who ultimately decided against playing at Louisville, had this to say:&nbsp;"I knew they weren't college girls. It was crazy. It was like I was in a strip club."</p><p><span>Another former recruit told OTL that McGee provided them with money to tip the strippers and negotiated for them to have sex with the women of their choosing.</span></p><p><span>Powell's three daughters, who allegedly took part in the pay-for-sex scandal, recalled Russ Smith and Montrezl Harrell being among the players involved.</span></p><p><span>Harrell, who now plays for the Houston Rockets, denied the accusations, saying,&nbsp;</span>"I don't know anything about it. I didn't too much stay at the dorm. I stayed off campus. I had a girlfriend off campus. ... It was pretty shocking that took place, if it did. I'm right there with Coach [<a href=#>Rick Pitino</a>], as shocked as he is."</p><p>After the latest report, former Louisville player Chane Behanan commented on the allegations on his Facebook page:</p><p>The University of Louisville released a statement in response to the allegations Tuesday: "To preserve the integrity of the review process, the university will withhold comment on any details until the review is concluded."</p><p>However, Louisville athletic director Tom Jurich said, "Coach Pitino has no plans to step down and he absolutely didn't know about the allegations," via <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Andy Katz</a> of ESPN.</p><p>Louisville President James Ramsey reinforced Wednesday that there are no plans for Pitino to retire, per <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Steve Jones</a> of the&nbsp;Courier-Journal.</p><p>On Thursday, Pitino released a statement reiterating his desire to remain with the Cardinals, via his <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">official website</a>:</p><p>To our loyal fans,</p><p>First, above all, I’m sorry we all have to endure the pain of these allegations. I so appreciate your support and friendships.</p><p>I will not resign and let you down. Someday I will walk away in celebration of many memorable years but that time is not now. I do not fight these accusations by others but rather turn the other cheek. Couldn't do it at 33, but at 63 it's the wise thing to do. Let's let the investigators do their job and we will play basketball.</p><p>Pitino, when asked about Tuesday's report, said he was "devastated" and "disappointed," via <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Jeff Greer</a> of the Courier-Journal.</p><p><span>"There's only one person who can speak on this matter, and that's Andre McGee," Pitino <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">added</a>, per <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Pat Forde</a> of Yahoo Sports. "He owes it to his teammates, coaches and t<span>he university to tell the truth. The truth has got to come out, and it can't just be to the NCAA."</span></span></p><p>No action has been taken against the Louisville basketball program, as an NCAA investigation is ongoing.</p><p><span>McGee, who is now an assistant coach at the University of Missouri-Kansas City, has been&nbsp;placed on administrative leave&nbsp;while the NCAA continues to gather facts.</span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmianJqupLTEq6meqJ%2BnwW%2BvzqZmmqqknrCtsdJoaW5wYG59dnnFqKmmnaJiubDByKytoqScmnqxuMCynKurXaeypL7UoqusZaSaua15zq2jZpmSpMK1ecSxp56qmZq7pLHSZq6irJhirq%2Bw0Z5kppuXmrI%3D</p></div><div id=links><a href=./hilda-baci-wiki-whats-her-ethnicity-nigerian-chef-religion-and-family-details.html>&#171;&nbsp;Hilda Baci Wiki: Whats Her Ethnicity?
