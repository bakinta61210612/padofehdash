A descendant of Sir William Bruce, the 17th-century baron, had inherited the property after defeating a Scottish group of Presbyterians in 1680 — and cutting off their hands and heads in battle.</p><img decoding=async aria-describedby=caption-attachment-362297 alt="Haunted Spiral Staircase In Earlshall Castle" width=600 height=900 data-sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/allthatsinteresting.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/haunted-spiral-staircase-in-earlshall-castle.jpeg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p id=caption-attachment-362297 class=wp-caption-text><span class=credit>Savills</span><span class=caption-body>The spiral staircase “haunted” by Sir Andrew.</span></p><p><a href=# rel=noopener>According to</a> The Smithsonian, however, the agency listing it hasn’t been too keen on mentioning Bloody Bruce — as his name appears to be “unhelpful” with sales, preferring to focus on its ample living space.</p><p><a href=# rel=noopener>According to</a> Savills, the castle grounds are comprised of 34 acres with an additional 19 acres of grazing. They hold beautiful walled gardens, added in 1890, that surround topiary lawns, a bowling green, a rose terrace, and even another, secret garden.</p><p>Sir William Bruce named the castle after “The Erlishall,” a hunting lodge owned by the Earls of Fife. These were relatives of <a href=# rel=noopener>Robert the Bruce</a>, who became King of Scots in 1306 and led the occupied territory against England during the First War of Scottish Independence.</p><p>Sir Bruce broke ground in 1546 and would welcome high-born visitors, including Mary Queen of Scots in 1561 and James VI of Scotland — who would later become James I of England. The monarchs had ridden from the royal palace of Falkland to take advantage of Earlshall’s unparalleled hunting grounds.</p><p>However, the castle’s most infamous tenant was Sir Andrew, the “Bloody Bruce.” The 5th Baron of Earlshall, Andrew inherited the fortress in the 1600s. At the time, a group of Scottish Presbyterians called Covenanters were protesting the British monarchy for serving as head of the Church of Scotland — which Sir Andrew violently defended.</p><img decoding=async aria-describedby=caption-attachment-362389 alt="Earlshall Castle Long Room" width=900 height=600 data-sizes="(max-width: 900px) 100vw, 900px" src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/allthatsinteresting.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/earlshall-castle-long-room.jpeg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p id=caption-attachment-362389 class=wp-caption-text><span class=credit>Savills</span><span class=caption-body>The Long Room of Earlshall Castle.</span></p><p>While historians disagree about the date of his nickname’s etymology, the reason behind it remains clear. Whether he was christened “Bloody Bruce” after the Battle of Airds Moss in 1680 or the Battle of Killiecrankie in 1689, the Baron of Earlshall was so ruthless on the battlefield that no other name would do.</p><p>As a supporter of King Charles II’s reign over his country’s religious institutions, Sir Andrew is said to have hacked the head and hands off Covenanter Richard Cameron. And although Sir Andrew died in 1696, the ruthless warrior is said to have continued inhabiting the Earlshall Castle halls.</p><p>After being inherited by the Henderson family of Fordell, the property was sold in 1824 and subsequently fell into dereliction. It traded hands for more than half a century before architect Robert Lorimer made thorough restorations beginning in 1890, adding three guest cottages and renovating ruinous parts of the castle.</p><p>“The magic is all Sir Robert Lorimer, who restored the castle and laid out the gardens,” <a href=# rel=noopener>said Jamie Macnab</a>, a real estate agent with Savills. “It is a genuine castle with vaulted ground floor rooms, a Great Hall, secret spiral stairs and musket holes.”</p><p>Indeed, Earlshall Castle boasts modern and medieval amenities.</p><img decoding=async aria-describedby=caption-attachment-362300 alt="Study In Earlshall Castle" width=900 height=600 data-sizes="(max-width: 900px) 100vw, 900px" src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/allthatsinteresting.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/study-in-earlshall-castle.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p id=caption-attachment-362300 class=wp-caption-text><span class=credit>Savills</span><span class=caption-body>The castle’s study.</span></p><p>The kitchen holds tiled stone floors and a modern dishwasher, fridge, and freezer. The sitting room comes with antique watercolor paintings, while the Great Hall has a fireplace and walls made of timber panels.</p><p>The dining room, too, has a fireplace and an alcove. The library and adjacent study hold two fireplaces and a built-in bookshelf and golden chandelier.</p><p>And while the alleged sound of footsteps of Sir Andrew on the staircase seems like a good cause to sell the 500-year-old castle, the real reason for the sale is far more wholesome.</p><p>“I have sold Earlshall Castle twice before in my 35 year career,” Macnab said.</p><p>“It is a very special place. The present owner is wanting to move back to Holland to be nearer to his grandchildren.”</p><p>After reading about Scotland’s haunted Earlshall Castle going up for sale, learn about <a href=#>7 haunted castles that will send chills down your spine</a>.
