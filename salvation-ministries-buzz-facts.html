With an estimated net worth of $41 million, he is listed among not just the richest pastors in Nigeria but on the African continent.&nbsp;</strong></p><p>Nigeria is a very diverse country made up of people from various ethnic groups. Generally, citizens of the country are very religious people, regardless of whether they are Christians or Muslims. On the Christian side, Nigeria has become the home of many popular and wealthy pastors. One of the richest among them is Pastor David Ibiyeomie.</p><p>He is the general overseer and founder of the Pentecostal church, Salvation Ministries. The very popular pastor began his church in 1997 and today, it is one of the fastest-growing ministries with over thirty branches in different parts of the world.</p><h3><strong>Profile Summary of </strong><strong>Pastor David Ibiyeomie&nbsp;</strong></h3><ul><li><b>Full Name:</b> David Ibiyeomie</li><li><strong>Date of Birth:</strong> 21st October 1962</li><li><strong>Age:</strong> 61 years old</li><li><strong>Place of Birth:</strong> Bonny Island, Rivers State, Nigeria</li><li><strong>Ethnicity:</strong> Ijaw</li><li><strong>Nationality:</strong> Nigerian</li><li><strong>Education:</strong> Rivers State University of Science and Technology, Port Harcourt, Nigeria</li><li><strong>Occupation:</strong> Pastor, Televangelist</li><li><strong>Marital Status:</strong> Married</li><li><strong>Spouse:</strong> Peace Ibiyeomie</li><li><strong>Net Worth: </strong>$41 million (est.)</li></ul><h2><strong>Pastor David Ibiyeomie Hails From Bolo Town, Rivers State</strong></h2><p>Pastor David Ibiyeomie was born in Bonny Island, Rivers State on October 21, 1962. His late parents were indigenes of Bolo Town in Ogu/Bolo Local Government Area of Rivers State. Sadly, there are no details about members of his family or even his childhood except for the fact that his father worked for an oil exploration company in the area. David grew up in an average Christian home and he chose to follow that path as he grew older.</p><p>As per his education, he had all his schooling in Port Harcourt. He first attended Banham Primary School Port-Harcourt before he transferred to Government Comprehensive Secondary School, Borikiri. In 1980, he got admission to study Microbiology at the Rivers State University of Science and Technology, Port Harcourt.</p><h2><strong>He Started His Ministry In Lagos At The Age of 35</strong></h2><p>After his education, David gave his life to Christ and received the divine message from God to set up his own church. In order to equip himself for the ministerial journey, he enrolled himself for bible school training at <a href=# data-wpel-link=internal>Bishop David Oyedepo</a>‘s Word of Faith Bible Institute (WOFBI), the Bible training arm of the Living Faith Church aka Winners’ Chapel. The name salvation ministries came after he finished from the Bible school. Upon completion, he sought the permission and blessing of his spiritual father and mentor, Bishop David Oyedepo, to begin the mandate he has received from God.</p><p>After receiving blessings and being granted permission by his spiritual father, he started a house fellowship with his family at 1689B, Buraimo Kenku Street, Victoria Island, Lagos. David Ibiyeomie&nbsp;later relocated to <a href=# data-wpel-link=internal>Port Harcourt</a> and started Salvation Ministries (Glorious Chapel) on April 13, 1997, at Plot 35, Birabi Street, G.R.A. Phase 1, Port Harcourt. He started the church with thirty-four members; 5 males, 10 females and 9 children in attendance including himself and his wife. Giving reasons for relocating his church to his home state, the minister said it is because he found that his father in the Lord, Bishop David Oyedepo, was already dominating the Lagos area.</p><p>Settling in Port Harcourt, the church continued to grow in size as attendees increased, prompting it to relocate again from its site at Plot 35, Birabi in July 1999, to Plot 17, Birabi Street.</p><h3><strong>Salvation Ministries Now Has Branches Across The World</strong></h3><p>Salvation Ministries officially began operating as a full ministry on April 13, 1997. Today, the Ministry has now become one of the fastest-growing churches in Nigeria with over 100,000 adult regular worshippers at the headquarters alone. The Ministry’s Cathedral Site (Hand of God) at Igwuruta, Port Harcourt in Rivers State is listed among the largest auditoriums in the world. It cost roughly N5 billion to complete with state-of-the-art, hi-tech facilities.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/buzznigeria.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/Pastor-David-Ibiyeomie-e1500565944232.jpg><p>The mandate of the church is to spread the gospel around the world.

It was alleged that the minister had on January 16, 2017, during his 5 nights of glory crusade, describe the Ogoni people as the most wicked and cruel tribe in Nigeria and that with only N500, an Ogoni man could make somebody go mad.</p><p>Reacting to the alleged claims, the apex organization of the Ogoni People known as&nbsp;The Movement for the Survival of the Ogoni People (MOSOP) described the comments as a show of immense hatred for the Ogoni people and essence for organizing the crusade in a time when the country is making efforts to build national unity and integration.</p><h3><strong>2. His Alleged Affair with Nollywood Actress Iyabo Ojo</strong></h3><p>In March 2017, journalist&nbsp;Kemi Omololu-Olunloyo&nbsp;alleged that Ibiyeomie was having an affair with Nollywood actress&nbsp;<a href=# data-wpel-link=internal>Iyabo Ojo</a>. Olunloyo was subsequently arrested and refused bail for defamation. However, she has been released. Ibiyeomie strongly denies the allegations.</p><h3><strong>3. His Alleged Threat To Kill Daddy Freeze</strong></h3><p>In September 2020, the Salvation Ministries pastor was dragged for allegedly threatening to kill Daddy Freeze, a Nigerian internet personality and radio show host, for criticizing Living Faith Pastor David Oyedepo. The video, which had Ibiyeomie repeatedly cursing Daddy Freeze by calling him a bastard, also has him threaten to kill him and tear him to pieces.
