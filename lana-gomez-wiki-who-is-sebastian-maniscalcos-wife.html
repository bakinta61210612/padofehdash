She is a frequent collaborator of Kelly Wearstler, and is one of the creators of the 10-foot guitar sculptures located on Sunset Strip’s Guitar Town.</p><h2><span id=The_Wealth_of_Lana_Gomez>The Wealth of Lana Gomez</span></h2><p>How rich is Lana Gomez?

At a young age, she showed a strong inclination towards the arts, particularly drawing. She eventually developed an interest towards painting, and this would help mould her to eventually decide to pursue the arts as a career.</p><p>After matriculating from high school, she enrolled at the University of Tennessee to complete a degree in Fine Arts. The university is located in Knoxville and was founded in 1794, just a few years before Tennessee would be officially recognized as a state of the country. The school has over 28,000 students enrolled annually and is ranked 104th among all national universities. They have several notable alumni and is associated with several other institutions of higher learning. It is also the only university to have three presidential papers editing projects, holding a collection of three US presidents from Tennessee. It is one of the oldest public universities in the US.<img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/biographypedia.org///biographypedia.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/c24b37d1ad418343685c9cddde994d35-732x1024.jpg></p><h2><span id=Art_Career>Art Career</span></h2><p>After completing her degree, Gomez moved to Los Angeles and began creating acrylic paintings which consisted of a combination of various kinds of elements as opposed to a more traditional style. This eventually drew attention to her, and one of the first people to notice her was interior designer Kelly Wearstler. The two began collaborating frequently, and she became a part of the design studio of Wearstler working on murals and being featured in the book entitled “Hue”. Her work would go on to be displayed in multiple art galleries in the country.</p><p>In the early 2010s, she had a showroom located in West Hollywood, and her work has also been featured in the Greystone Mansion, and in several publications including “Vogue”. She is responsible for the giant 10-foot guitar sculptures located in West Hollywood, and her increasing work has led her to a more diverse clientele. Her work can now be seen in offices, homes and iconic locations such as Beverly Hills. This has also led her to a life of luxury, as she resides in what is described to be a luxury home, alongside her well-known husband.</p><h2><span id=Husband_Sebastian_Masicalco>Husband – Sebastian Masicalco</span></h2><p>In 1998, <a rel=nofollow href=#>Sebastian</a> decided to move to Los Angeles to pursue a career in stand-up comedy. He frequently performed in open mics in bowling alleys and bars, while working as a waiter to make ends meet. He left his job in 2005 when he gained a regular performance slot at West Hollywood’s The Comedy Store. He studied other popular comedy acts such as Jerry Seinfeld, Johnny Carson, and Bill Burr, and over the years, his fame grew, as he became a part of the “Comedy Central Presents” specials. He also released his own specials through Showtime including “Aren’t You Embarassed”, “Sebastian Live”, and “What’s Wrong with People?”</p><p>He was featured in the “Wild West Comedy Show: 30 Days & 30 Nights” by Vince Vaught, and also made his way to television. He’s performed in “The Tonight Show with Jay Leno”, “The Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon”, “Conan”, and “The Late Show with Stephen Colbert”. He’s also done acting work, and made his debut in the Academy Award winning film entitled “Green Book”. He is also set to appear in the film “The Irishman” alongside Robert De Niro.</p><h2><span id=Personal_Life_and_Social_Media>Personal Life and Social Media</span></h2><p>For her personal life, it is known that Lana married Sebastian in 2013, and they have two children together. The two moved into a luxury home a year after their marriage, though details about it are scarce. Her father passed away in 2001, and her mother would remarry sometime later, and they reside in Naples, Florida. During her free time, Lana enjoys travelling, and frequents comedy shows with her husband. Her husband also often credits her during his shows.</p><p>Most of her art can be seen and viewed online, and it often consists of an abstract style. Similar to numerous painters and artists, she is active online through an account on social media, particularly on Instagram on which she has over 48,000 followers, using the platform to give a bit of insight towards her life away from work, often showcasing her two children and her husband. She often goes to red carpet events with her husband, and the two also love the great outdoors. She also spends a lot of time doing arts, and has been teaching her children painting from time to time. She promotes her work online, and has her own website with a portfolio of some of her recent paintings.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiamaS0s63PobCpnZSerm%2B70aBmpZmelnqou8yesWavmaC2bsPHqGSiq12osqOt0q2gmqZdoq6vtdKcmKWbn6h6uLXFnmY%3D</p></div><div id=links><a href=./instagram-twitter-implode-over-mms-allegedly-slut-shaming-green.html>&#171;&nbsp;Laura Byrne calls Abbie Chatfield a hypocrite over slut-shaming row</a>
