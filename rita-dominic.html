This was also where she grew up alongside her siblings and parents. Her parents were practitioners in the medical field; her father was a medical doctor, while her mother was a nursing officer. Though she had never revealed her parents’ names, the actress talks about how they have positively impacted her life and career. Meanwhile, in 2009, in an interview, she said that her biggest regret in life so far is that both her parents did not stay alive to at least eat the fruit of their hard labor on her.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/buzznigeria.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Rita-Dominic-family.png><p>Talking about her siblings, Rita is the youngest of four children: two sisters and a brother. The actress celebrated her brother’s birthday, Valentine, on 7th October 2013. Her two elder sisters are reportedly based in the United Kingdom. Rita and her siblings seem to share a strong bond, and asides from this, there are no further details known about her siblings and family.</p><p>For her secondary education, the ageless actress attended Federal Government College Ikot Ekpene, which is known to be a prestigious school in Akwa Ibom State, Nigeria. She then proceeded to the University of Port Harcourt, where she graduated with a Theatre Arts BA Honors’ Degree in 1999. Her course of study is just in line with her career, and this contributes to her satisfactory performance and achievements in the industry.</p><h3><strong>Controversies Surrounding Her Real Age</strong></h3><p>It is generally accepted that actress Rita Dominic was born on 12th July 1975. According to her, she was 40 years old as of 2015. Meanwhile, a lady who identified her name as Chika had claimed to be Rita’s primary schoolmate at Santa Maria primary school in Aba revealed that the actress did not make known her actual age. According to Chika, the 40th birthday that the actress celebrated in 2015 was supposed to be her 43rd birthday and should have been done three years earlier. Hence, she maintained that the actress brought down her age by three years.</p><p>If this claim is anything to go by, then it means that Rita Dominic is allegedly 51 as against the 48 years old, which is believed to be her actual age. However, there has been no evidence to show that the actress debunked or accepted these claims. Instead, she had decided to keep mute and not respond to it.</p><h2><strong>She Began Her Professional Acting Career in 1998 </strong><strong>at the age of 23</strong></h2><p>With a strong passion for acting, actress Rita Dominic has had an established career in the Nigerian film industry. Interestingly, she grew a passion for acting when she was only a little girl of five. She started participating in her school drama competitions and many children’s TV shows in her hometown in Imo State. She did not only develop an interest in acting but also in music, though her acting side has subsequently overridden her passion for music. However, she stated that she had to take a break to concentrate and complete her education.</p><p>While she was still an undergraduate at UNIPORT, in her 300 level, Rita made an entrance into Nollywood to fully dispense her long-time passion for acting. She bagged her first movie role in the 1998 film, A Time to Kill and subsequently in Children of Terror. Even though she is not a major character, the creativity and uniqueness with which she carried out her role in the movie gave her public relevance, and thereafter, she began to get bigger roles. In the following year, she got a role in the film Aba Riot and was opportune to share the screen with Nollywood Legends <a href=# rel=noopener data-wpel-link=internal>Olu Jacobs</a> and Segun Arinze.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/buzznigeria.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Rita-on-set.jpg><p>By the time she was 33, Rita had already become a household name in the film industry. She was one of the major characters in the highly acclaimed 2008 movie White Waters. So far, the well-celebrated actress has featured in more than 200 Nollywood blockbusters. She is a highly talented actress who understands her screen roles and carries them out with physical and emotional perfection.<br></p><h3><strong>List of Her Most Popular Movies</strong></h3><ul><li>Children of Terror</li><li>Back from America</li><li>Unforgettable</li><li>Lean on Me</li><li>Working Class Lady</li><li>True Romance</li><li>Singles & Married</li><li>Lost Paradise</li><li>Shattered</li><li>Last Wedding</li><li>Queen of My Heart</li><li>Desperate Billionaire</li><li>Unbreakable Affair</li><li>Yankee Girls</li><li>The Big Fat Lie</li><li>Legal War</li></ul><h2><strong>Other Businesses that Contribute to Rita Dominic’s $3.5 Million Net Worth</strong></h2><p>Rita Dominic is also into production and has co-produced many movies. In one of her interviews, when asked why she decided to go into film production, the actress responded that she had always wanted to explore all aspects of filmmaking. She further explained that at a point in her career, she was silently blacklisted in the film industry and so was not getting work. Hence, she decided to evolve and do something different. According to the actress, she is still acting but currently gives a more significant part of her time to production.</p><p>Delving into movie production, she established a production company Rita Dominic Productions wherein she is the CEO. She is also the co-founder of The Audrey Silva Company (TASC), one of the leading entertainment companies based in Lagos, Nigeria. The company, whose aim is to produce quality African content, was founded in 2010 by multi-award-winning director Mildred Okwo and the star actress. TASC has gained massive audience patronage, great media support, and high visibility for embarking on innovative projects.</p><h3><strong>She Also Makes Money Through Lucrative Endorsement Deals</strong></h3><p>The star actress also has a good part of her net worth contributed by many lucrative deals she continues to sign with top companies. In March 2021, she concluded a deal with GetFit Company, a popular Nigerian fitness company. She took to her Instagram page to celebrate this feat which she considered a great one. In her words, she said: I am super excited to announce to you all that I’m now the newest brand ambassador of @getfitng. She added that she has over time used their products and can attest to their effectiveness.</p><p>The Nollywood actress was in November 2016 unveiled as the Brand Ambassador of BK Unique Hair, a Canadian luxury hair brand. The unveiling ceremony was held during a media lunch at Sleek Square, Victoria Island, Lagos State, and had in attendance <a href=# data-wpel-link=internal>Kate Henshaw</a>, <a href=# data-wpel-link=internal>Toke Makinwa</a>, Yvonne Vixen Ekwere, and others. The CEO of BK Unique Hair, Blessing Kenneth, in her speech, stated that she chose to collaborate with Rita because she is a sophisticated brand like the luxuriant BK Unique Hair.</p><p>Another good year for the Nollywood star actress was in 2014. She made a deal that is said to run in millions of naira with <a href=# data-wpel-link=internal>Keystone Bank</a>, one of Nigeria’s commercial banks. For a straight one year, she was the face of Keystone Bank. Actress Rita also has an endorsement deal with LG Electronics and was unveiled on 15th April 2021. With all these businesses, deals, and other side investments, Rita Dominic is in no doubt smiling down her bank account.</p><h2><strong>Rita Dominic’s Awards and Accolades</strong></h2><p>The multi-award-winning actress has walked home with numerous accolades and awards due to her on-screen prowess, which has grown better with time, just like wine.
