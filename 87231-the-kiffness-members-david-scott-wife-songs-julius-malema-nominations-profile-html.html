David Scott, the brainchild of the act, has been in the limelight for his controversial remarks that have, in most instances, rubbed people the wrong way. He recently made a video where he was comparing Julius Malema to Adolf Hitler. You might want to read on for more details about how everything went down and how the public reacted to it.</p><h2>The Kiffness profile</h2><h2>The Kiffness South Africa</h2><p class=align-left><a href=#>The group</a> has had the rare opportunity to perform in some of the headlining slots during reputable festivals like Splashy Fen & Park Acoustics and Rocking the Daisies, to mention a few. They have also performed in international gigs in countries like Seychelles, Lesotho, Zimbabwe, Swaziland, and Vietnam.</p><h3>The Kiffness members</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-briefly.akamaized.net/images/ec0e86a6bf0aba76.jpg><p class=align-left>The project started in 2011, and over the years, some of the members left while others joined the journey. The members who are currently available are:</p><h4><strong>Raiven Hunter</strong></h4><p class=align-left>Raiven Hunter, the saxophone and synth extraordinaire, joined the project in 2017. Before Raiven joined the group, he had been behind the scenes and had co-written some of The Kiffness songs. He currently plays the saxophone and is also in charge of the keys.</p><h4><strong>Mathew Gold</strong></h4><p class=align-left>Mathew Gold is the third dynamic of the project. He joined the band in a couple of shows. In the electronic act, he is the guest vocalist.</p><p class=align-left>Mvelo Shandu was part of the project between 2011 and 2013, and he was in charge of bass. Clem Carr joined the project in 2014 and left in 2016. He played the saxophone and was in charge of the keys.</p><h3>David Scott</h3><p class=align-left>David Scott came up with the idea of the project in 2011. At the time, he had relocated to Cape Town to pursue his studies at <a href=# title>Rhodes University.</a> He had experience in playing a couple of musical instruments, as he had been part of several bands and had worked as a DJ in several nightclubs. Therefore, he chose to channel his background and reliable experience in music by fusing them into a live electronic act.</p><p class=align-left>David Scott's journey in production was humbling at the beginning as he would work from his bedroom. His resilience saw him own a studio and grow to become one of the most renown producers in the country. He has had the coveted opportunity to work with some stars like Moonchild, Shortstraw, Tresor, Mathew Gold, and Samuel Miller, to mention a few.</p><p class=align-left>Besides the musical roles that he plays in the project, he is also in charge of handling the group's social media pages; hence, he is known to many as The Kiffness.</p><h3>David Scott wife</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-briefly.akamaized.net/images/17748162997ed98c.jpg><p class=align-left>The name of David Scott The Kiffness wife is Jute Scott, and it turns out that she is also into music. In April 2020, during the lockdown, she worked alongside her husband in<i> Irish Blessing (May the Road Rise to Meet You)</i>, a song that David performed on Instagram. The Kiffness dedicated the song to the medics who were in the fight against the pandemic.</p><h3>The Kiffness nominations</h3><p class=align-left>David Scott, the brainchild of The Kiffness, has had a significant impact on the South African music industry. So far, he has racked up 3 SAMA nominations. Ten of his singles have been playlisted on national <a href=#>radio stations</a>. The ten songs have secured the top ten positions in the top 40 charts.</p><h3>The Kiffness new songs</h3><p class=align-left>If you have not had a glimpse of any of The Kiffness songs, worry not. Here are some of the hits that you ought to check out:</p><ul><li><i>Mmusi Maimane</i></li><li><i>Sugarman</i></li><li><i>Broccoli song</i></li><li><i>Lose You</i></li><li><i>Hadeda</i></li></ul><h3>The Kiffness Julius Malema</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-briefly.akamaized.net/images/0e110950788ebb07.jpg><p class=align-left>David Scott is not only known for his sensational music but also for the controversies that he gets involved in. He recently stepped on Julius Malema's toes less than three months after a nearly similar incident.</p><h4><strong>The Kiffness Jerusalema</strong></h4><p class=align-left>In September 2020, Scott took a dig at <a href=#>Julius Malema</a> in a Parody of Master KG's and Nomcebo's hit song, <i>Jerusalema</i>. In the parody, he said Julius Malema would</p>fight for your hair, but he doesn't care about you or me or corruption or GBV.<p class=align-left>The backlash came after the <a href=# title>Clicks advert</a> that went wrong and sparked public outrage in September.</p><h4><strong>Comparing Julius Malema to Adolf Hitler</strong></h4><p class=align-left>On 15th November 2020, The Kiffness jumped onto the Democratic Alliance bandwagon when he compared the Economic Freedom Fighters and the Nazis. He did so through his YouTube channel where he incorporated an audio recording from TED-Ed entitled,<i> How did Hitler rise to power?</i> In the visuals of the video, he used photos of the EFF and Julius Malema.</p><p class=align-left>The opening remarks of his videos were a tweet by the DA saying,</p>The Nazi’s had the brown shirts that went around terrorising minorities. South Africa has the red shirts. #BrackenfellHigh<p class=align-left>In the video, he compared the country's history and the birth of the EFF to Adolf Hitler and Nazis. He also compared the disruptions that the EFF causes in parliament and the racist unrests associated with the party with the Nazis' rise to power and Adolf Hitler.</p><p class=align-left>In the video, he urged people to make up their minds and went ahead to state how "similar the parallels are...we can learn from history and make sure history it isn’t repeated here in South Africa, peace."</p><p class=align-left>He penned off the video with a quote from Martin Luther King Jr saying,</p>We must learn to live like brothers or perish together as fools.<h4><strong>Reactions from the public</strong></h4><p class=align-left>After sharing the parody video on YouTube, David Scott shared it on his social media handles to seek the opinion of the public. <a href=#>Mzansi</a> was torn on whether or not to support his analogy. These are some of the reactions that the post fetched,</p><h4><strong>Some netizens defended Malema</strong></h4><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-briefly.akamaized.net/images/3f32bb14b0ec5264.jpg><p class=align-left>Some of the social media users thought that comparing Julius Malema to Adolf Hitler was exaggerated. Some went ahead to state that they did not think Malema hated any race, unlike Hitler, who oversaw the extermination of the Jews. Would you fall on this side of the divide?</p><h4><strong>Some Twitter users supported his idea</strong></h4><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-briefly.akamaized.net/images/50226cdd2312303f.jpg><p class=align-left>Other social media activists were excited that he had confidently come up with the comparison. They applauded him for how direct the comparison was. Others joined him, saying that they had tried for the longest time to bring it out that way in vain.</p><p class=align-left>What are your thoughts on the parody video and the controversial remarks that The Kniffness made about Julius Malema?
