White, who is known for her fashion videos in which she creatively customizes old items from her wardrobe, purchased a gray jumpsuit from the brand's Spring/Summer 2023 collection for <strong>$2,100</strong>.</p><p>While most people would treat a designer garment with care, White had other ideas. She took a pair of scissors and slashed the onesie down the center, transforming it into a tiny crop top and miniskirt à la <strong>Julia Fox</strong> (the Miu Miu set is shaking). White repurposed the legs of the jumpsuit as leg warmers, wasting no fabric.</p><span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-171 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span><p>And to cut into a garment designed by <strong>Miuccia Prada</strong> and <strong>Raf Simons</strong> was certainly a bold move on White's part — and her decision to take scissors to brand-new Prada has elicited mixed reactions online.
