In 2017 alone, he had 2,093 yards from scrimmage and 19 total touchdowns. One year after that, he had 21 total touchdowns.</p><p>Last season, Gurley had career lows in rushing yards (857) and total yards (1,064).

His left knee became an issue late in the 2018 season and again last year. In June, Gurley's trainer told CBS Sports'&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Dave Richard</a>&nbsp;that Gurley was dealing with an "arthritic component to his knee."</p><p>The knee, one team official explained, is why the Rams were unable to trade Gurley. Teams are extremely suspicious that it's problematic.</p><p>Teams can now sign him to a more team-friendly deal than they would have inherited in a trade, which should spark the market somewhat. But sources around the league aren't sure how much.</p><p>There will be interest in Gurley at some point, because teams will get desperate and will think back to a few years ago when he dominated the league. But right now, the interest is minimal.</p><p>That's in part because Gurley presents a problem with <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">the NFL's rules</a> regarding physical exams. Players aren't allowed into team facilities at least until March 31 due to the coronavirus pandemic, and team doctors aren't allowed to travel to free agents. All physical exams must be done by an independent physician, and since most franchises only trust their doctors, physicals have slowed to a crawl.</p><p>It's also a buyer's market for running backs.&nbsp;</p><p>Many franchises that need a back are content to wait for April's draft to get one.&nbsp;And even among the free-agent crop, Melvin Gordon III, Devonta Freeman and Carlos Hyde were already available.&nbsp;</p><p>The market right now for backs is so depressed that Gordon&nbsp;isn't getting close to the $10 million per year that the Los Angeles Chargers offered him last summer,&nbsp;<span>according to NFL Network's Mike&nbsp;Garafolo (via<span>&nbsp;</span></span><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Pro Football Talk</a><span>)</span>.</p><p>It isn't that NFL teams have decided running backs shouldn't get big money.
