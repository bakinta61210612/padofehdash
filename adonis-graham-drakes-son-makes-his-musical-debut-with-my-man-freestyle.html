world, and his hope for a better future for him.</p><p>Drake also shared photos of his son for the first time on Instagram in March 2020, along with a heartfelt caption about missing his family and friends amid the COVID-19 pandemic.</p><p>He wrote: “I love and miss my beautiful family and friends and I can’t wait for the joyful day when we are all able to reunite.”</p><p>Since then, Drake has posted more pictures and videos of Adonis on social media, showing their close and loving relationship.</p><h2>What is “My Man Freestyle”?</h2><p>“My Man Freestyle” is Adonis’ debut song, which he

father and his passion for basketball.</p><p><strong>Some of the notable lines from the song are:</strong></p><ul><li>“I’m Adonis Graham, I’m the man / I got blue eyes like my maman / I got curly hair
