He also admitted there was very little he could do about it, per Chris Medland of F1i.com:</p>Chris Medland <span class=acct>@ChrisMedlandF1</span><p lang=en dir=ltr>Alonso says the steering locked during his testing accident and McLaren has changed the steering rack among other things #F1</p>Chris Medland <span class=acct>@ChrisMedlandF1</span><p lang=en dir=ltr>Alonso also says: "I don't know if you've seen the video but even a hurricane would not move the car at that sort of speed" #F1</p><p>Reports had suggested that the two-time world champion had suffered memory loss in the wake of the accident, with El Pais (h/t <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Byron Young and Ed Malyon</a> of the Mirror) claiming that the McLaren driver “woke up 1995.”</p><p>However, Alonso has dismissed those claims ahead of his return to racing, per Formula 1:</p>Formula 1 <span class=acct>@F1</span><p lang=en dir=ltr>Alonso on his accident: "I didn't wake up in 1995, I didn't wake up speaking Italian. I remember the accident &amp;amp; everything the next day"</p><p>Indeed, the Spaniard appeared pretty desperate to get back behind the wheel. McLaren really missed his composure and quality in the opening race of the season as team-mate Jenson Button could only toil to an 11th place finish; Mercedes’ <a href=#>Lewis Hamilton</a> won the race at a canter.</p><p>Alonso insisted it wasn’t the finest spectacle to watch from the sidelines and reassuringly claimed there was nothing to worry about ahead of his return to action, per ESPN F1:</p>ESPN F1 <span class=acct>@ESPNF1</span><p lang=en dir=ltr>Alonso: "There are zero problems and zero worries from my side."</p>ESPN F1 <span class=acct>@ESPNF1</span><p lang=en dir=ltr>Alonso jokes about watching Melbourne from sidelines: "I don't think I picked the best race to watch"</p><p><h2 class=streamElement>Alonso Will Return at Malaysian Grand Prix</h2></p><p><h3 class=streamElement>Monday, March 23</h3></p><p>News off the Spaniard's clearance to return to racing was confirmed by Sky Sports News HQ:</p>Sky Sports News <span class=acct>@SkySportsNews</span><p lang=en dir=ltr>Fernando Alonso cleared to race in Malaysian Grand Prix - more details on #SSNHQ</p><p><h2 class=streamElement>Boullier: McLaren has 'Nothing to Hide'</h2></p><p><h3 class=streamElement>Friday, March 13</h3></p><p>McLaren racing director Eric Boullier earlier detailed why the team continues to keep information quiet surrounding the crash. As reported by <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Edd Straw</a> of Autosport, Boullier says Alonso's medical files should be kept private. He also indicates tests on the car are yet to provide conclusive results.</p><p>We first cared about Fernando being cared for by the doctors and, as far as I know, that is a personal thing so nobody has access to the medical files except the doctors.&nbsp;The second thing [is that], technically, on the car, we have conducted all the investigations very transparently and openly with the FIA.</p><p>Everything we have conducted so far, we couldn't find anything wrong or which has implied the accident.&nbsp;We are still looking for further investigations, but we have given our report to the FIA and we are working with the FIA.&nbsp;Nothing else can be said on this. We have nothing to hide.</p><p>Boullier added doctors are "happy" with Alonso's checks.</p><p><h2 class=streamElement><span>Fears Grow Over Alonso's Formula One Future</span></h2></p><p><h3 class=streamElement><span>Thursday, March 5</span></h3></p><p><span>Byron Young of the Mirror previously <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">revealed</a> that fear is growing over Alonso's potential return to Formula One following the crash. Young provided the following details:</span></p><p>Mirror Sport has learned that doctors and crash investigators have not excluded the possibility the double champion may have blacked out BEFORE the accident that has ruled him out of the season-opener in Australia a week on Sunday.</p><p>One eye witness who has seen footage of the smash at Turn 3 in Barcelona said far from losing control dramatically at high speed when he went off, as first reported, Alonso’s car simply just drove off the track.</p><p>Alonso's management team could not be contacted yesterday, and McLaren have refused to comment on his medical condition.</p><p><h2 class=streamElement><span>McLaren Rules Alonso Out of Australian Grand Prix</span></h2></p><p><h3 class=streamElement><span>Tuesday, Mar. 3</span></h3></p><p><span>McLaren previously confirmed Alonso won't compete in Mar. 15's season opener:</span></p>McLaren <span class=acct>@McLarenF1</span><p lang=en dir=ltr>Following medical advice, Fernando will not be competing in the Australian GP.

No one knows, perhaps not even Fernando."</p><p>Boullier recently denied press reports, saying, "I have read and heard a lot of things, especially from the Italian and Spanish press," per <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">grandprix.com</a>, "and 90 per cent of it is false."</p><p><h2 class=streamElement><span>Alonso Shows Return to Health in Video Message</span></h2></p><p><h3 class=streamElement><span>Friday, Feb. 27</span></h3></p><p><span>Alonso sent a message to his fans on Feb. 27, publicly displaying his improved condition and stating his intention to make a quick return to action:</span></p><p><h2 class=streamElement><span>Dennis Confirms Alonso Lost Consciousness, May Miss Melbourne<br></span></h2></p><p><h3 class=streamElement><span>Thursday, Feb. 26</span></h3></p><p><span>McLaren CEO Ron Dennis confirmed Alonso lost consciousness during the crash, tweeted by Grand Prix Times:&nbsp;&nbsp;<br></span></p>Motorsport Week <span class=acct>@MotorsportWeek</span><p lang=en dir=ltr>Dennis confirms Alonso was "unconscious in the car for a short period of time". He added that they've rested him on doctors orders #F1</p><p>Nevertheless, McLaren originally expected Alonso to line up on the grid for the opening race of the season:</p>Motorsport Week <span class=acct>@MotorsportWeek</span><p lang=en dir=ltr>Alonso will need to be declared fit by FIA to take part in first race, but McLaren see no reason why he won't pass #F1</p><p><h2 class=streamElement><span>Alonso Released from Hospital</span></h2></p><p><h3 class=streamElement><span>Wednesday, Feb. 25</span></h3></p><p><span>Alonso was discharged from hospital more than three days on from his crash in Formula One testing.</span></p><p>According to <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">motorsport.com</a>, the Spaniard was released on the afternoon of Feb. 25 after his father, his manager Abad, and Boullier had visited him earlier on in the day.</p><p>As noted by the <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">BBC</a>, the former Ferrari man has returned to his family home to rest ahead of the new season.</p><p><h2 class=streamElement><span>Alonso 'Does Not Remember' Crash</span></h2></p><p><h3 class=streamElement><span>Tuesday, Feb. 24</span></h3></p><p><span>Abad</span>&nbsp;suggested he doesn't possess the details of exactly what caused the accident. He says Alonso was conscious when he arrived at his side, per&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Chris Medland</a>:</p><p>It’s information that I don’t have at the moment. I read information that is quite difficult to understand. When I arrived at the [medical centre] at the racetrack Fernando was conscious and fine in this respect. So this is the most important thing. And now he’s fine.</p><p>The crash was very hard. We don’t have images but it was very hard and he has to recover because it was a serious impact and Formula One is not a game. We have to be sure that he is ready to drive the car at the right time because we want to be competitive until the last race of the season.</p><p><span>Flavio Briatore, an important figure in Alonso's career, recently told radio Rai (h/t <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">motorsport.com</a>) that the driver doesn't recall the crash: "The important thing is that the (medical) tests are all negative. He does not remember the incident, but that is normal. I think tomorrow he will be out of the hospital."</span></p><p><h2 class=streamElement><span>McLaren Confirm Accident Caused by 'Unpredictably Gusty Winds'</span></h2></p><p><h3 class=streamElement><span>Monday, Feb. 23</span></h3></p><p><span>Alonso was said to have undergone medical tests on Feb. 23, according to <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Andrew Benson</a> of BBC Sport.</span></p><p><span><span>Boullier called the incident "just one of those things," as reported by <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Benson</a>. The F1 team <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">provided</a> some additional insight into the accident:</span></span></p><p>Over the past 24 hours, we have been carrying out a detailed analysis of the damage to Fernando’s car, and its associated telemetry data, in order fully to understand the cause, or causes, of his accident. Even at this early stage, we have been able to reach some firm conclusions.</p><p>His car ran wide at the entry to Turn Three—which is a fast uphill right-hander—allowing it to run onto the Astroturf that lines the outside of the track. A consequent loss of traction caused a degree of instability, spitting it back towards the inside of the circuit, where it regained traction and struck the wall side-on.</p><p>Our findings indicate that the accident was caused by the unpredictably gusty winds at that part of the circuit at that time, and which had affected other drivers similarly (eg, Carlos Sainz Jnr).</p><p>We can categorically state that there is no evidence that indicates that Fernando’s car suffered mechanical failure of any kind. We can also confirm that absolutely no loss of aerodynamic pressure was recorded, which fact indicates that the car did not suffer any aerodynamic loss, despite the fact that it was subjected to a significant level of g-force. Finally, we can also disclose that no electrical discharge or irregularity of any kind occurred in the car’s ERS system, either before, during or after the incident.</p><p><span>After the incident Alonso's manager tweeted a photo of the driver from the hospital, via ESPN F1:</span></p>ESPN F1 <span class=acct>@ESPNF1</span><p lang=en dir=ltr>Fernando Alonso's manager has just tweeted this picture of the Spaniard #f1 http://t.co/Iz1ewVa4wt</p><p><h2 class=streamElement><span>Alonso Airlifted to Hospital After Crash</span></h2></p><p><h3 class=streamElement><span>Sunday, Feb. 22</span></h3></p><p>Today at 12:35 CET, while testing at the Circuit de Catalunya (Barcelona), during the fourth and final day of the current test, Fernando Alonso's McLaren-Honda car left the track at Turn Three, causing the right-hand side of his car to strike the wall.</p><p>Fernando was driven to the circuit's Medical Centre where the circuit's doctors gave him first aid.</p><p>He was conscious and spoke with the doctors.</p><p>However, as per usual procedure in such circumstances, he was then airlifted to hospital where he is undergoing precautionary checks.</p><p>"<span>Result of Alonso's CT scan is good and Fernando is fine—effectively un-injured," McLaren later announced, courtesy of <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Ted Kravitz</a>.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>McLaren confirmed Alonso initially suffered a concussion, via <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Rachel Brookes</a> of Sky Sports.</span></p><p>Sky Sports News HQ provided an image of the helicopter:</p>Sky Sports News <span class=acct>@SkySportsNews</span><p lang=en dir=ltr>Fernando Alonso is going for precautionary checks after his crash in Barcelona #SSNHQ http://t.co/YybMevj2wN</p><p><span>Alonso, who switched from Ferrari to&nbsp;<span>McLaren this season, is trying to bounce back from last year after he didn't win a single race.
