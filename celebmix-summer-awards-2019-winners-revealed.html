Now, we are excited to finally reveal the lucky winners of the 2019 CelebMix Summer Awards.</p><h3>Song of the Summer – ‘Bounce Back’ by Little Mix</h3><p>If you have not heard <a href=#>‘Bounce Back’ by Little Mix</a> yet you must have lived under a rock this summer. The track was the first single Little Mix released under RCA Records after leaving Syco Music, and needless to say, we are loving this new era. With three different videos for the song, the girls of Little Mix have spoiled their fans who happily welcome new material from the group. With its catchy chorus and modern trap-pop beat, ‘Bounce Back’ is the perfect summer song and a deserving winner of our Song of the Summer 2019 award.</p><p></p><h3>Movie of the Summer – Avengers: Endgame</h3><p>Although it was nominated in a competitive category, it is no surprise that Avengers: Endgame was chosen as your Movie of the Summer. Since the premiere in April, Avengers: Endgame has grossed $854.2 million in North America and $1.936 billion in other areas, which means that it has earned&nbsp; $2.790 billion worldwide – pretty impressive! If you compare the <a href=#>box office sales</a> with the critical reviews and the overwhelmingly positive fan reactions, you get a 100% deserving winner of Movie of the Summer 2019.</p><p></p><h3>Star of the Summer – Louis Tomlinson</h3><p>With over 60% of the votes, Louis Tomlinson was the clear winner of our Star of the Summer award. After releasing the heartbreakingly beautiful single ‘Two of Us’ earlier this year, it is obvious that Louis has some stellar music coming up and we cannot wait to hear more from him this year. 2019 has been devastatingly hard for Louis and his family, yet he takes the time to maintain his relationship with his fans and keep up his work on his debut solo album.&nbsp;In December, Louis won our award for <a href=#>Biggest Inspiration</a>, which shows that he is not just a star when it comes to his profession; he is a star with all of his being, right from his enormous musical talent to his big heart and loving personality.</p><p></p><h3>Artist of the Summer – BTS</h3><p>The competition was incredibly tight, but you have crowned none other than BTS as your Artist of the Summer! BTS have gone from strength to strength this year since the release of Map of the Soul: Persona, which saw them gain their first UK Number One album and break a record held by The Beatles for the most Number One albums in the space of a year on the Billboard 200 chart. Boy With Luv became a summer smash hit that has had us ‘Oh My My My’-ing ever since its release and the group has just finished their first ever Stadium World Tour where they played to hundreds of thousands of fans. It’s no surprise that BTS have come out on top as your Artist of the Summer.</p><p></p><h3>Podcast of the Summer – Glowing Up</h3><p>Refuting the principle of “playing it safe”, Esther and Caroline have established themselves as sought after creators in the world of beauty and health. Working against the grain, the duo’s podcast “Glowing Up” takes up every possible topic from areas like beauty, health, and sexuality to create discourse around them. Collaborating with experts and other creators, they have managed to build a safe space for listeners who are often called out for their love of trends and glitters. Having been consistent with their quality, it’s no surprise that our readers chose “Glowing Up” as the Podcast of the Summer.</p><h3>YouTuber of the Summer – James Charles</h3><p>It hasn’t been the easiest of years for James Charles. After YouTuber Tati Westbrook accused him of manipulating someone’s sexuality and promoting rival products to hers, the star received tonnes of hate on social media and lost more than a million YouTube subscribers as a result. He also canceled his Sisters tour, which similarly caused controversy at the time over its pricing. James said the whole experience had been “the darkest we’ve all ever seen and it’s also been the darkest time I’ve had to go through in my life”.&nbsp;Luckily, the situation has been cleared up James has regained the majority of his subscribers – and lots of public support, too! The whole experience taught us (as fans) a lot about “cancel culture” and why we shouldn’t always believe everything we read on Twitter. Winning the CelebMix Award for YouTuber of the Summer is a huge pat on the back for James – and we’re pleased we get to celebrate his success. We can’t wait to see what he gets up to next!</p><p></p><h3>Fandom of the Summer – Louies (Louis Tomlinson)</h3><p>When we announced the CelebMix Summer Awards, Louis Tomlinson’s fans were the first to spread the word. In fact, every time Louis is nominated for an award, releases a new song, or just does something noteworthy, his fans are there to support him. Most artists have a good relationship with their fans, but the relationship between Louis and his fans is unlike anything we have seen before – it is on a different level. There is an emotional bond between the two parties that is unbreakable and incredibly strong – it is something all artists aspire to have but it is so unique that it can be hard to achieve in the same way. There is no doubt that Louis appreciates and loves his fans – and the feelings are highly reciprocated. With everything they do, Louies are deserving of the award for Fandom of the Summer 2019.</p><p>Congratulations to all of the winners! Did your favourite win?
