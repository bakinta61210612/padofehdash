He has also never been married at any time in the past. The 46 year-old former pro boxer is currently dating Gallienne Nabila, a woman who is almost half his age.</strong></p><p>Floyd has dated many women in the past, including models, strippers, actresses, and entrepreneurs. He came close to getting married a number of times. But then, the often polarizing and controversial father of five has failed to make it to the altar. With a long list of women who became his girlfriends at different points in the past, here is a look at his love life of Mayweather:</p><h2><strong>Did Mayweather Get Married?</strong></h2><p>No, Floyd did not get married, and he has never been a married man even though he is already getting to his mid-ages. Speaking about why he is not yet married, ‘The Pretty Boy’ made it clear that it is for the same reason why divorce rates are so high.</p><p>He said although people keep asking him why he is not yet married, he revealed he doesn’t have anything about people who are already married, but the only person he trusts is himself, which removes any form of disappointment. He made the revelation on his Instagram, maintaining that is what he believed in and nothing more.</p><p>Even though he has never seen a reason to get married, Mayweather still came very close a number of times when he engaged some of his girlfriends. Some women he came close to marrying include Shantell Jackson, whom he engaged for three years, and Josie Harris.</p><h2><b>Floyd</b><strong>&nbsp;Mayweather Is Now Dating Gallienne Nabila</strong></h2><p>At the moment, the woman the former fighter is dating is a social media influencer and model Gallienne Nabila. Born on 24 February 1977 and now 46 years old, she is more than 20 years younger than Mayweather. They were first linked to each other as a couple in 2019, but the relationship did not last long before it came to an end after a brief stint.</p><p>They got back together again in 2021 when he was claimed to still be in a relationship with stripper Anna Monroe. This left the stripper heartbroken. Close sources claimed she made it clear she was done with the fighter as he was always having something to do with other women.</p><p>For yet another time, Mayweather and his model girlfriend were not together for a long time after they returned. This did not stop him from getting her a £160k brand new Maybach for her 24th birthday in 2022. It is unclear at what point they found their way back to each other again, but by April 2023, they were seen back together enjoying a cozy moment at a Clippers game at the Crypto.com Arena in California.</p><p>While it may be easy to link her fame and rise to the boxer, Floyd Mayweather’s girlfriend has mostly made a name for herself as a model with more than 1.3 million followers on Instagram.</p><h2><b>Who Has Floyd Mayweather Dated in the Past?</b></h2><p>While no woman has ever risen to become Floyd Mayweather’s wife, the legendary boxer has dated many women in the past, some of whom he engaged, while he had kids with others. Here are some of his most memorable relationships:</p><h3><strong>Floyd Mayweather and Josie Harris</strong></h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/buzzsouthafrica.com/us/wp-content/uploads/sites/4/2023/08/Josie-Harris-e1693304232474.jpg><p>One of Floyd Mayweather Jr.’s longest relationships was with Josie Harris, whom he dated for close to 15 years and were engaged for four years. The former lovers met for the first time in 1995. At the time, Mayweather was a young man of 19 years, while Josie was only 16. Their paths crossed at a bowling alley in LA, and soon afterward, they became an item.</p><p>Although their relationship would go on to survive for more than a decade, and they would have three kids together, it was a rather volatile one. This did not stop them from almost walking down the aisle after Floyd engaged Josie in 2010.</p><p>By 2014, they called off the engagement, and the relationship ended. While they were still together, Mayweather was slammed with a two-month prison sentence following his conviction in 2010 over a case of <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow external noreferrer" data-wpel-link=external>domestic violence against Josie</a>.</p><p>The relationship ended because of the many cases of physical abuse she allegedly suffered at the hands of the champion. She claimed that she was abused at least six times in his hands. After the demise of the relationship, the woman who almost became Floyd Mayweather’s wife revealed that whenever she thought of him coming, she used to suffer anxiety.</p><p>In June 2020, Mayweather’s ex-girlfriend and baby mama died following an accidental overdose, which<a href=# rel="noopener nofollow external noreferrer" data-wpel-link=external>&nbsp;the coroner</a> said&nbsp;was “mixed drug toxicity.” Harris was 40 years old at the time when she died in her home in Southern California, Los Angeles.</p><h3><strong>Floyd Mayweather and Melissa Brim</strong></h3><p>Melissa Brim is another who dated Money May. Brim and the fighter began dating in 1998 when he was 21 while she was 18. When they started out, the relationship seemed as though it was a thing designed to last a long time, but it didn’t.</p><p>How they met was never stated, but it is no secret that their relationship led to the birth of Mayweather’s child, Iyana, in 2000. Unfortunately, the relationship ended the same year. The reason why they broke up was, again, the alleged abusive nature of Floyd in relationships. One of the assaults she suffered at his hands happened in public when he assaulted her in a Las Vegas shopping center.</p><p>Details of the incident indicated that Mayweather punched his baby mama three times in the face after opening the car door into her head. The altercation got so serious that she had to call the cops from the safety of a convenience where she was taking refuge. Mayweather was charged to court, where he pleaded guilty to two counts of domestic battery.</p><p>For the crime, he was slammed with a suspended sentence of six months behind bars and house arrest of 2 days. He was also made to pay a fine of $3,000 and was subjected to a community service of 48 hours.</p><h3><strong>Shantel Jackson and Floyd Mayweather</strong></h3><p>Another long relationship that Mayweather had was with American actress Shantel Jackson. The pair dated for eight years before they finally decided they had had enough of each other. They met for the first time in 2006 when Shantel was working as an air hostess. Although the circumstances behind their meeting were not made known, what is known is that at the time, she was 21 years old at the time, while the entrepreneur was 29.</p><p>In 2010, 4 years after they started dating, Mayweather and Jackson got engaged. Sadly, she did not end up becoming Floyd Mayweather’s wife, as after close to four years, they called off the engagement and went their separate ways. The end of their relationship came as a surprise to many as in 2011, she made a post thanking everyone for their support and added that their wedding was going to be on January 17, 2011.</p><p>According to Mayweather, the reason why his relationship with Shantel came to an end was because she carried out an abortion, and he was against killing babies. He accused her of killing their twin babies. He also accused her of undergoing an extensive cosmetic surgery procedure.</p><h3><strong>Floyd Mayweather and Anna Monroe</strong></h3><p>Anna Monroe also makes it to the list of Floyd Mayweather’s past girlfriends. A model, social media influencer, and professional stripper, Anna and Floyd met for the first time after he hired her to serve as the head stripper of his club in Las Vegas. The professional relationship soon turned romantic after he caught sight of her leaving work one day, and he fell for her.</p><p>They were not together for a very long time before claims emerged that they were already engaged and preparing to get married. In fact, Monroe was already meeting wedding planners, according to close sources, in preparation for the big day that would make her Floyd Mayweather’s wife. That was not to be, as she dumped the boxer after photos of him with Gallienna Nabila, who was already his ex at the time, went viral, showing the two together in New York. Monroe was in Las Vegas at the time.</p><p>The stripper got devastated and ended things with him. Nonetheless, there were allegations that he tried getting back to her by sending her $5 million and also promising to get her a yacht, but she was said to be angered by his acts, accusing him of always thinking everything was all about money.</p><h3><strong>There is a Rumor That Keyshia Cole was Floyd’s Girlfriend</strong></h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/buzzsouthafrica.com/us/wp-content/uploads/sites/4/2023/08/Keyshia-e1693305673336.jpg><p>Grammy-nominated singer and actress Keyshia Cole is yet another woman who was said to have been the girlfriend of the boxer at different points between 2008 and 2018. The rumor persisted even though the singer was married to Daniel Gibson from 2011 to 2020.</p><p>Cole made it clear in different interviews that she was not dating Money Mayweather, but media reports insisted she was only being economical with the truth. To add to the reports that they were probably dating, there was an incident in 2016 when the boxer got Cole a Mercedes-Benz.</p><p>A year before they allegedly broke up, BET reported that Cole went as far as changing the time of her performance from 7 p.m. to 2 p.m. in Philadelphia because she couldn’t wait to be together with the boxer on fight night when he was slugging it out with Connor McGregor in Las Vegas.</p><p>There was also another speculation that since she was separated from her husband at the time, she might settle with the fighter and soon become Floyd Mayweather’s wife. That was not to be, as nothing more has been heard about them as a couple since 2018.</p><h3><strong>Mayweather Is Also Claimed To Have Dated Lil Kim&nbsp;</strong></h3><p>Lil Kim also joins the list of women who were said to have been involved with Mayweather. The two were said to have dated briefly in 2011 before they ended the relationship.</p><p>Nonetheless, the boxer and rapper continue to remain very close friends to this day. In an Instagram post in 2016, Lil Kim revealed that she had been friends with Floyd for many years, and she appreciated their friendship even though they always fought and settled. She described him as her BFF and a great father figure for her daughter.</p><p>There was never anything about how the pair met, if they actually dated, and what might have led to their breakup.</p><h2><strong>Other Women Who Were Floyd Mayweather’s Girlfriends</strong></h2><p>Apart from the aforementioned, there are other women who have briefly dated the fighter in the past or were rumored to have had a thing with him.</p><p>One such is Doralie Medina, who started out as his massage therapist before she became his girlfriend for a brief period after Shantel broke up with him. They were together from 2014 to 2015.</p><p>Rozonda ‘Chilli’ Thomas is yet another woman linked to Mayweather. Reports claimed they dated from 2008 to 2010 and then decided it was best to go their separate ways.</p><p>Before she married her husband, Ray J, Princess Love Norwood was previously linked to Mayweather. The two started dating in 2012, but by 2014, it was alleged that Mayweather found out she was cheating on him with Ray, and that led to the end of the relationship. She married the rapper in 2016, and they are still together.</p><p>Another person who was linked to him was Nikki Mudarris in 2017. However, the Pretty Boy made it clear that he was not dating the reality TV star and entrepreneur, that they were only associates. In the same year, he was rumored to be dating British reality star Abbie Holborn, but nothing serious came from it.</p><p>Prior to that, in 2016, the Boxing champion made headlines when it was reported that he was dating 19-year-old Brit Raemarni Ball. The pair went public with the relationship, including on social media, but it ended not long after it began. The reason for the sudden end of the relationship was never made known.</p><p>Controversial actress Lindsay Lohan, as well as Lauren R. Wood, Jessica Burciaga, and Erica Dixon, are other women who were said to have dated Mayweather.</p><h2><strong>Mayweather Has 5 Kids From His Different Relationships</strong></h2><p>While he has never walked down the aisle, Floyd Mayweather is a father of five kids. He had three of his kids with Josie Harries, one with Melisa Brim, and his other child was adopted.</p><p>The oldest of his kids is singer and songwriter Koraun Mayweather, who was born to him by Harris on November 7, 1999. Koraun does not have the best relationship with his father. Mayweather’s second child is Iyanna Mayweather, who was born to him by Melissa Brim. Iyana was born on May 20, 2000. She is now pursuing a career as a model and rapper. More so, she has a child with her boyfriend, <a href=# data-wpel-link=internal>NBA YoungBoy</a>.</p><p>The next of his kids, Zion Shamaree Mayweather, was born to him from his relationship with Harris. The celebrity kid and social media personality was born on March 3, 2001. Zion is also a fashionista. There is also Jiraj Mayweather, who is his last child with Josie Harris. Jirah was born on June 20, 2003, and is a social media personality.</p><p>The adopted child of the legendary boxer is Devion Cromwell, who was born in 1996. There is no mention of who his biological father is, but his mom is Mayweather’s former girlfriend and baby mama, Melissa Brim. He adopted the kid when he started dating the entrepreneur.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiapa%2FHtLvUrZ%2BanqKesKJ6wqikaK2jZLOtu9idZKaZqayyosDHnqmsZaees6Z5yKxkoZ1doq6zvsiem2anomKxosDIp55mmZ6uvK%2Bxjg%3D%3D</p></div><div id=links><a href=./ithaca-new-york-resident-critically-injured-after-a-fatal-crash-the-world-obits.html>&#171;&nbsp;Ithaca New York Resident Critically Injured After A Fatal Crash The world obits</a>
