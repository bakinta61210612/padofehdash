She is from Texas, San Antonio, and <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">was born</a> on 25th September 1986. So, how old is Faye Hadley? She is currently 35 years old.</p><p class=align-left><strong>PAY ATTENTION: </strong><a id=https://briefly.co.za/8119-new-facebook-algorithm-how-briefly-news-news-feed-now.html#8119 href=#>Click</a> “See First” under the “Following” tab to see Briefly News on your News Feed!</p><p class=align-left>Not much is known about her parents, but information from her socials and other sources online indicate that her biological parents are divorced. Her father is an academician; he obtained a PhD from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, while her mother, Cindy Copeland, has been described as Faye's supporter on several occasions.</p><h3>Faye Hadley's educational background</h3><p class=align-left>Faye was one of the brightest students amongst her peers while in <a href=#>high school</a>. She went on to gain admission into the prestigious Harvard University, where she bagged a degree in psychology in 2010. Faye was about 22 years when she graduated from Harvard.</p><h3>Career</h3><p class=align-left>Hadley was one of the <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">leading females</a> in the profession of car repairs in America, although she worked as a therapist in an organisation immediately after graduating from Harvard University as a psychologist.</p><p class=align-left>After working there for a while, Lafayette still felt a longing for what she had always been passionate about since her teenage years; she wanted to get her hands on tools and know cars and repair them.</p><p class=align-left>Describing her passion during an interview, she said:</p>I love helping people, but as a therapist, you just jump into people's lives, it was too intense for me. I want to help people; with a car, I can just jump in right away - I can change an alternator and make a check-engine light go away!<p class=align-left>Faye confessed that she had an early life crisis by trying to displease her inner child for a shot at the corporate ladder. It took her mother's input to get her to make a concrete decision about her passion for cars.</p><p class=align-left>Afterwards, she informed her employers that she would be resigning two weeks after, and she relocated to Portland to chase her passion. It was not all roses for Faye immediately after making this decision; she had to return to <a href=#>learning about cars</a> in a garage as an unpaid intern.</p><p class=align-left>More so, the <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">mechanic woman</a> attended numerous classes at a community college in her locality and was able to get a job with a Toyota dealership. She also used the opportunity to acquire several certifications that matter to her goals.</p><p class=align-left>Anya has since worked in several independent car repair workshops but eventually started her repair company known as Pistons & Pixiedusts. The organisation focuses on empowering and educating women.</p><p class=align-left>She has been one of the primary characters in television reality shows like <i><a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">All Girls Garage</a></i> and recently became the host of a show titled <i>The Best of Top Gear</i>. She also shares her knowledge on an <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">eponymous YouTube channel </a>that she manages.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-briefly.akamaized.net/images/7ac456f48acc91cb.jpg><h2>Personal life</h2><p class=align-left>Faye Hadley <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">married Brandon Hadley</a>. The duo first met in 2015, and about a year later, precisely on Faye's 30th birthday in 2016, they tied the knot.</p><p class=align-left>Faye Hadley's spouse is a wood artist. The duo's pictures on their respective social media pages indicate that they love doing the same things outside of their primary occupations. They are without a child yet.</p><h2>Body measurements and personal appearance</h2><p class=align-left>Faye Hadley's height is around 5 feet and 8 inches, which means that she is about 172 centimetres tall. She weighs about 121 pounds, and her pictures show a lady who tries to stay healthy and manage her weight.</p><p class=align-left>Despite her job requiring her to get her hands dirty, Faye is still a beauty whenever she wants. She has her signature facial makeup that has been applauded and criticised; she even made a YouTube tutorial video on how her fans can make their faces up like hers.</p><h2>Faye Hadley's net worth</h2><p class=align-left>According to the Biogossip website, Faye's <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">net worth</a> is estimated at $500,000. She has built a business and a legacy capable of going strong for years to come. As a businesswoman, teacher, mentor, social media personality, and accidental television personality, Faye makes enough to live a comfortably fulfilling life with her husband.</p><p class=align-left>Faye Hadley is one woman who proves that a woman can do what a man can do, if not better. Despite graduating from one of the most prestigious schools in the <a href=#>world</a>, she felt a hollow that would only be filled when she faced her fears about chasing her mechanic dreams.</p><p class=align-left><strong>READ ALSO:</strong> <a href=#>Who is Paige Tamada?
